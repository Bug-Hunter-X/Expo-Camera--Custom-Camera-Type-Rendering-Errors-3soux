This bug occurs when using the Expo's `Camera` API with custom `Camera.Constants.Type` values.  The Camera might not render correctly or throw an error, even if the custom type seems valid. This is often due to an incompatibility between the custom type and the underlying camera implementation.  For example, trying to use a non-standard type like `'CUSTOM'` might lead to unpredictable results.
